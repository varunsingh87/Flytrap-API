# Flytrap API

The Flytrap API is the new REST API for [Flytrap](https://audio.borumtech.com). Flytrap is an audio cloud service. You make HTTP requests to [Flytrap API endpoints](https://api.audio.borumtech.com) and receive a JSON response, documented on the [Borum Developer Docs](https://developer.borumtech.com/Flytrap/Docs).
